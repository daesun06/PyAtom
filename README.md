# PyAtom

This is a simple atomic model implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for visualization. The model includes classes for Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons, as well as an Atom class that combines these particles to create a visual representation of an atom.

TODO:

- Make a element creator that takes in the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons and creates the corresponding atom.
- Make the atoms move around the screen.
- Add a photon class that can be emitted when an electron moves to a lower energy level.
- Make that the electrons can move to higher energy levels when they absorb a photon.
- Make so that the left click will emit a couple of photons in different directions.

Future improvements:

- Add more elements to the model.
- Electron superposition: Allow electrons to exist in multiple states simultaneously, representing the probabilistic nature of their positions.
- Quantum tunneling: Implement a feature where electrons can pass through energy barriers, demonstrating quantum tunneling effects.
- Spin and magnetic properties: Incorporate electron spin and its associated magnetic properties to provide a more comprehensive atomic model.
- Interactive energy levels: Allow users to interact with the energy levels of electrons, enabling them to move between levels and observe the resulting changes in the atom's behavior.
